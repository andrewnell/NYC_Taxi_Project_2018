# NYC_Taxi_Project_2018
### NYC FHV and Taxi Project Conducted by Jack Lundquist and Andrew Nell
Continuation of Project work for Applied Data Science Class at NYU CUSP in Fall 2017 including team memebrs:
* Prince Abunku
* Maham Khan
* Lior Melnick

In order to download the data and group into functional formats that can be used for analysis use the Taxi_Data_Wrangling.ipynb notebook.  The TLC taxi data at an individual trip level is massive! So this notebook takes ages to run and requires substantial computational power. The individual trip data can be amended within this notebook to be used for other purposes. 

Once you have processed data you can use the TaxiVisualizations_2018.ipynb notebook to output some of the figures and gifs. All images are created are stored in the images folder and data sets saved in data folder.
